# Grid Integration of Wind Energy Conversion System

This project report explores the principles, modeling, simulation, and challenges of integrating wind energy into the electrical grid. Conducted as part of the **Power System I Laboratory (EEE 306)** course at BUET, it presents a comprehensive study of Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS), including aerodynamic analysis, control strategies, and Simulink-based implementation.

## Objectives

* Analyze the operation and characteristics of wind turbine systems.
* Investigate challenges in grid integration of wind energy.
* Design and simulate a 2.5 MW wind turbine model using MATLAB Simulink.
* Implement control systems for MPPT and doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG).

## Key Topics Covered

* Wind turbine design and aerodynamics
* Wind turbine power curves and performance factors
* Doubly-Fed Induction Generator modeling
* AC-DC-AC converter implementation using IGBTs
* Vector control systems (DQ transformation)
* Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)
* Grid-side and rotor-side converter control
* Simulation results showing dynamic performance under variable wind speeds

## Features

* Simulink model of a complete WECS integrated with a power grid
* Rotor and grid-side control with PI controllers
* Wind power output curves and system performance analysis
* Discussion on model limitations and potential improvements

## Limitations

* No pitch or yaw control mechanisms included
* Simplified mechanical system using ideal gain instead of full drivetrain modeling
* No handling of power capping for wind speeds above rated values
